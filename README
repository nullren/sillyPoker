silly Poker is a program I started writing to fill the rather gaping hole in
the unix gaming world. And to polish my programming skills. But it seems like
everyone and his brother has written a solitaire clone of some sort, but
there doesn't seem to be a poker game. So, here it is. ;)

Send all bug reports, fixes, patches, constructive criticism, etc. to
kmradlof@colby.edu. Send all flames to, well, kmradlof@colby.edu. At least it
shows you care a little bit.

Notes for v0.25:
As far as I know, the text and curses interfaces should work great (although I
have seen some issues on machines other than my own with the curses ui). The
Qt interface is still under construction. If you have any issues/idea/whatever
regarding any of the interfaces, *PLEASE* send me comments. This is a very
important area to me. :)

Please check the man page/poker mini howto for more info on how to play and
configure silly Poker.

Installation:
Just run ./configure, make, and then make install if you like.
If you have Qt, you may want to try configure with the --enable-qt option.
