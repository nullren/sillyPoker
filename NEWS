As far as I know, the text and curses interfaces should work great (although I
have seen some issues on machines other than my own with the curses ui). The
Qt interface is still under construction. If you have any issues/idea/whatever
regarding any of the interfaces, *PLEASE* send me comments. This is a very
important area to me. :)

Please check the man page/poker mini howto for more info on how to play and
configure silly Poker.
