Legend:
- needs to be done
+ in the process of doing
* done

Immediate:
- fix config file saving/loading to work in windows (how? do I need to? ;)
+ change view() to show which round it is in the game
+ fix Hand::score() to correctly handle 7 card hands
- add "graphical" cards to curses ui
- cleanup code ;)
- revamp gameplay code to be event-based
- recode games to be object-based

In the near future:
- a generic, configurable AI to allow players to choose the attitude of their
  opponents
+ a nifty Qt interface
