How to Play Poker in 3 Easy Steps ;)
---------------------------------

1. The basics of five card draw poker

In five card draw poker, the dealer first deals five cards to ever player. The
player to the left of the dealer then begins the first betting round. Each
player then has the option of either calling (matching the bet), raising
(increasing the size of the bet), or folding. Raises must be at least the size
of the original bet.

After all players have either called or folded, the draw phase begins.
Starting to the dealer's left, each player discards a number of cards and is
dealt the same number of new cards. Each player can also choose to "stand
pat," or discard no cards.

The final betting round then begins. Betting begins to the left of the dealer,
and continues until all players have called or folded.

The hands of the players still in the pot are then turned over, and the player
with the highest hand wins the pot. In order of highest to lowest, the
possible hands are:
1. straight flush
2. four of a kind
3. full house
4. flush
5. straight
6. three of a kind
7. two pair
8. two of a kind

2. The basics of five card stud

Each player is dealt one card face down and one card face up. A betting round
then takes place. Each player is dealt another face up card, followed by a
betting round. This is repeated twice more, until each player has one face
down card and four face up cards. All the hands are then revealed, and the
highest hand wins.

3. The basics of seven card stud

Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up. A betting round
then takes place. Each player is dealt another face up card, followed by a
betting round. This is repeated twice more. Each player is then dealt a face
down card, and another betting round takes place. The hands are then revealed,
and the highest hand wins.
